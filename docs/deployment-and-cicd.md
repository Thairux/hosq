# Deployment and CI/CD

## Deployment Strategy
The Hosq application is designed for serverless deployment environments.

- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify.
- **Backend/API**: Supabase Edge Functions.
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL.

## Continuous Integration
We use GitHub Actions for automated quality checks.

### Example Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck
      - run: npm run build
```

## Production Deployment Checklist
1. Verify all Environment Variables are set in the hosting provider.
2. Ensure Supabase RLS policies are correctly configured.
3. Check that BulkSMS API tokens (`BULKSMS_TOKEN_ID`, `BULKSMS_TOKEN_SECRET`) are stored in Supabase secrets.
4. Run a final production build and test in a staging environment.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 2. BulkSMS.com Configuration

The SMS functionality requires BulkSMS.com API tokens configured in Supabase Edge Function secrets:

- BULKSMS_TOKEN_ID
- BULKSMS_TOKEN_SECRET

Set them with Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase secrets set BULKSMS_TOKEN_ID=your_token_id BULKSMS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
supabase functions deploy send-sms
```

### 3. Database Setup

The database schema is already created with the following tables:
- `queue_stages` - Defines the patient journey stages
- `emergency_flags` - Emergency conditions for priority handling
- `patients` - Patient records
- `queue_entries` - Active queue entries with positions
- `queue_history` - Historical tracking of patient movement
- `patient_emergency_flags` - Links patients to emergency flags
- `user_roles` - Staff role assignments
- `sms_logs` - SMS notification history

Default stages are pre-configured:
1. Registration
2. Doctor Consultation
3. Billing
4. Pharmacy

### 4. Create Admin Account

To create your first admin user, use the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- First, create the user through Supabase Auth Dashboard or API
-- Then insert the role:
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role, is_active)
VALUES ('user-uuid-from-auth-users', 'admin', true);
```

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
